# The Food Park
This is an Ordering System Application based on Vue and Electron for a small business that offers meals, snacks and beverages.

## About the project
In working this project, I applied my knowledge on best practices in writing Vue App, organizing the files and directories so I won't get lost in maintaining it and currently (at the time of this writing) this is my workflow in working with Vue App or any frontend projects and still working on improving it over time because my goal is not just implementing features and logics but also deliver a well-organized project.

I also write the backend of this project using Laravel but the repo is private because this is a live app.

### Plugin Installed
1. MomentJS
2. ElementUI
3. Axios
4. Vuex
5. Vuex-orm
6. VueRouter & VueRouter Multiguard
7. VueNumeric

Note: This is my personal project and the small business I talked about is mine as well. So I can decide if this repo goes public. :grin:
